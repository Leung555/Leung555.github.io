Hi, I'm Binggwong Leung — a robotics researcher from Thailand. I recently completed my Ph.D. in Information Science and Technology at the BRAIN Lab, VISTEC. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Osaka Institute of Technology and Menlo Research.

My work explores the intersection of bioinspired design, neural control, and embodied AI — with a focus on enabling legged robots to move, adapt, and interact with their environment in intelligent ways. I’m especially interested in neural control for multilegged locomotion, object manipulation, and collective object transportation.

If you're curious about what I’ve been working on, feel free to check out my [publications](https://leung555.github.io/publications).

I'm always excited to connect with people who are passionate about robotics — whether it's for research, collaboration, or just to geek out about robots. Don’t hesitate to reach out!
